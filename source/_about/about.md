I am a **Lead Designer** highly experienced in solving **performance, accessibility and User eXperience** issues. I spent the last 10 years **designing websites and applications** & and pushing organization forwards.
I also know **Front-End Development constraints** and I am able to fill the gap between designers and developers in a team, with solution based on **Atomic Design** and tools like **Design System**.
